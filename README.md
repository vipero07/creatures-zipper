2. Either click browse or drag drop zips and files onto the site.
3. ???
4. Profit! (download the compiled zip and extract over the game folders)

## Bugs and feedback

This is a pretty rough project to do some fairly basic things so there is bound to be bugs. Please be vocal over on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vipero07/creatures-zipper/issues).

## Why U Do This?

I've been playing and tweaking the Creatures games for a very long time, modifying them, Jedi Knight, Doom, and Half Life are a big reason I started programing to begin with. The creatures games themselves I've been on and off with playing them, and everytime the installation process is quite a [task](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_3_%26_Docking_Station_Community_Recommended_Fixes_and_Addons#Common_Issues). I wanted to simplify it, not only for myself, but also for the [amazing community that has been alive and well for a very long time](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_Community_Spirit_Festival).

## Additional Thoughts

It is generally frowned upon repackaging other's work especially in the creatures community, as such it wouldn't be right to make this into a tool that lets you just check off the patches you want. That also means you shouldn't use this to make mega patches beyond personal use. For me, I plan on making mega patches, storing them in the cloud, and using them each time I plan on playing the game again. Just to reduce the time it takes to get up and running. All while still checking [Mad's excellent guide](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_3_%26_Docking_Station_Community_Recommended_Fixes_and_Addons#Common_Issues) to recommended fixes and addons for additions or changes.
